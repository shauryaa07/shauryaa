Got it — let’s break this down clearly.

You said your Raplet app is supposed to connect people in a video room (like Zoom). But when two users join:

Each user only sees themselves (their own video).

They don’t see the other user.


You’ve told the Raplet team, and they keep saying “it’s fixed,” but it’s still not working.

✅ Likely causes

This is a WebRTC signaling / peer connection issue — not just a visual glitch.
Here are the most common reasons this happens:

1. Signaling server issue

When one user joins, their offer/answer (SDP) or ICE candidates are not being exchanged correctly between peers.

So each user’s camera starts locally (they see themselves) but no connection is established between them.



2. Room ID mismatch

Sometimes the app creates a new room for each user by accident, even if they think it’s the same room.

That means they’re actually in two different rooms with the same name showing, but not linked.



3. ICE / STUN / TURN servers misconfigured

If your STUN or TURN servers are not working or not publicly accessible, peers won’t connect — especially if both users are behind NAT/firewalls.



4. Permission or browser issue

Sometimes, if you test on the same browser tab or device, the local and remote streams overlap incorrectly (you only see yourself).

Try on two different devices (e.g., phone + laptop) to confirm it’s not a local test artifact.

🧠 How to diagnose quickly

Try this checklist:

1. Open DevTools → Console → look for ICE connection failed, setRemoteDescription errors, or “No remote stream” warnings.


2. Confirm that both users have the same room ID in the console logs.


3. Use a public STUN server like:

{ urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" }

and a reliable TURN server if NAT traversal is needed.


4. Test on two separate networks (e.g., mobile data + Wi-Fi).

🛠 Likely fix

If Raplet’s backend is managing signaling, they probably:

are not correctly broadcasting peer offers/answers to other clients in the same room,

or are creating multiple isolated sockets per user instead of joining one shared socket room.


So the root cause is:

> The peer-to-peer signaling channel isn’t correctly sharing SDP and ICE data between users in the same room.

If you can share:

the JavaScript snippet where peers connect (the RTCPeerConnection, ontrack, and socket.emit parts),
or

a small console log output from both users,


I can pinpoint the exact bug for you — likely a one-line fix.

Would you like to paste that part of your code here (the part handling video connection and signaling)?
